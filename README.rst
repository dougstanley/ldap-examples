About
=====

These are some examples of openldap. Two ldif files specify some
objects to be added. One script (hopefully) mostly installs the 
required packages, and goes through the prompted setup, and finally
populates the directory with the entries from the two ldif files.

The other script, has a couple examples of searching.
